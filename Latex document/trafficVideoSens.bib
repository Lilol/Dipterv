  abstract = {Automatic video analysis from urban surveillance cameras is a fast-emerging field based on computer vision techniques. We present here a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art computer vision for traffic video with a critical analysis and an outlook to future research directions. This field is of increasing relevance for intelligent transport systems (ITSs). The decreasing hardware cost and, therefore, the increasing deployment of cameras have opened a wide application field for video analytics. Several monitoring objectives such as congestion, traffic rule violation, and vehicle interaction can be targeted using cameras that were typically originally installed for human operators. Systems for the detection and classification of vehicles on highways have successfully been using classical visual surveillance techniques such as background estimation and motion tracking for some time. The urban domain is more challenging with respect to traffic density, lower camera angles that lead to a high degree of occlusion, and the variety of road users. Methods from object categorization and 3-D modeling have inspired more advanced techniques to tackle these challenges. There is no commonly used data set or benchmark challenge, which makes the direct comparison of the proposed algorithms difficult. In addition, evaluation under challenging weather conditions (e.g., rain, fog, and darkness) would be desirable but is rarely performed. Future work should be directed toward robust combined detectors and classifiers for all road users, with a focus on realistic conditions during evaluation.},

  abstract = {Pedestrian density estimation is one of the key problems in intelligent transportation systems and has been widely applied to a number of applications in other fields of engineering. Counting-by-regression methods are more favorable for coping with such a problem owing to their robustness against interperson occlusion and relaxing the impractical requirement of a high video frame rate, compared to counting-by-detection and counting-by-clustering methods. However, imagery features in the existing counting-by-regression approaches are extracted from the whole region or spatially localized cells/pixels of each single video frame, which omits the unique motion patterns of the same pedestrians across the neighboring frames. In the light of this, this paper exploits a novel tensor-formed spatiotemporal feature representation and applies it in a multilinear regression learning framework, which can capture spatially distributed dynamic crowd patterns by discovering the latent multidimensional structural correlations of tensor features along both spatial (i.e., horizontal and vertical) and temporal dimensions. Extensive evaluation with the public UCSD and Shopping Mall benchmarks demonstrate superior performance of our approach to the state-of-the-art counting methods even when the surveillance data has a low frame rate.},

The problem is formulated as one of energy minimization in reduced road-parameter space, from which internal and external camera parameters are determined. Our approach combines bottom-up processing of a video to find a vanishing point, lines in the background, and a directed activity map, along with top-down processing to fit a road model to these detected features using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Enhanced autocorrelation along the dashed lines is used in conjunction with a best-fit road model to find road-to-image parameters. To maximize both robustness to noise and flexibility (e.g., to handle cases in which the camera is looking straight down the road), a single-vanishing-point length-based approach (VWL, according to the taxonomy in the work of Kanhere and Birchfield) is used. On a large number of data sets exhibiting a wide variety of conditions (including distractions such as bridges and on/off-ramps), our approach performs well, achieving less than 10% error in measuring test lengths in all cases.},

The luminosity information side channel allows the system to effectively handle rapid changes in illumination, which is typical of outdoor applications and bottleneck of the existing background pixel classification methods. A novel algorithm for detecting and removing partial and full occlusions among blobs is also proposed. Partial occlusions are detected by evaluating the ratio between the area of the vehicle and the area of the vehicle's convex hull and are suppressed by identifying a cutting line using curvature analysis. A predictive model of the shape and motion features of the vehicles over consecutive frames instead corrects the error of the previous levels when full occlusions or background-vehicle occlusions occur in the scene. Quantitative evaluation and comparisons on some real-world scenarios demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both vehicle detection and processing time, particularly due to the robustness and the efficiency of the background-modeling algorithm.},

In this paper, we propose a layered graph model in image (RGB) and depth (D) domains for real-time robust multipedestrian tracking. The motivation is to investigate high-level constraints in RGB-D data association and to improve the optimization from the trajectory level to the layer level. To construct a layered graph, we define constraints in the depth domain so that pedestrian objects in the image domain are assigned to proper layers. We use pedestrian detection responses in the RGB domain as graph nodes, and we integrate 3-D motion, appearance, and depth features as graph edges. An online updating depth factor is defined to describe the depth relationships among the observations in and out of the layers, and the occlusion issue is processed with an analytical layer-level strategy. With a heuristic label switching algorithm, multiple pedestrian objects are optimally associated and tracked. Experiments and comparison on five public data sets show that our proposed approach significantly reduces pedestrian's ID switch and improves tracking accuracy in the cases of serious occlusions.},

The methods presented can be classified into color-space thresholding, edge detection, and chromatic/achromatic decomposition. Our support vector machine (SVM) segmentation method and speed enhancement using a lookup table (LUT) have also been tested. The best algorithm will be the one that yields the best global results throughout the whole recognition process, which comprises three stages: 1) segmentation; 2) detection; and 3) recognition. Thus, an evaluation method, which consists of applying the entire recognition system to a set of images with at least one traffic sign, is attempted while changing the segmentation method used. This way, it is possible to observe modifications in performance due to the kind of segmentation used. The results lead us to conclude that the best methods are those that are normalized with respect to illumination, such as RGB or Ohta Normalized, and there is no improvement in the use of Hue Saturation Intensity (HSI)-like spaces. In addition, an LUT with a reduction in the less-significant bits, such as that proposed here, improves speed while maintaining quality. SVMs used in color segmentation give good results, but some improvements are needed when applied to achromatic colors.},

This study deals with human-observed flow counts collected from traffic videos of freeway cameras. The available videos are mainly used for the purpose of manual observation by transportation personnel in case of emergency. This amounts to a varying inconsistency of the quality of the videos, which presents an additional challenge when analyzing the data. Video processing cannot be performed due to the mentioned issues with regard to the video quality. The processing has to be manually performed by humans who unfortunately have an inherent bias. If the video data have to be used for validating flow detector sensors, then a technique that performs validation with subjective and dynamic erroneous data as a result of the human bias is needed. This paper presents a methodology to deal with this issue. It is based on statistical testing with heteroscedasticity, which is demonstrated through a case study using data from traffic flow detectors and traffic cameras installed on highways in the Southern Nevada Region. A model for the relationship between the video ratings and the distribution of the human errors is developed taking into consideration the human bias. A method for identification of faulty detectors is also demonstrated based on the developed technique.},

Global navigation satellite systems suffer from multipath propagation rendering this solution insufficient. Herein, we present a real-time system for six-degrees-of-freedom ego localization that uses only a single monocular camera. The camera image is harnessed to yield an ego pose relative to a previously computed visual map. We describe a process to automatically extract the ingredients of this map from stereoscopic image sequences. These include a mapping trajectory relative to the first pose, global scene signatures and local landmark descriptors. The localization algorithm then consists of a topological localization step that completely obviates the need for any global positioning sensors such as GNSS. A metric refinement step that recovers an accurate metric pose is subsequently applied. Metric localization recovers the ego pose in a factor graph optimization process based on local landmarks. We demonstrate centimeter-level accuracy by a set of experiments in an urban environment. To this end, two localization estimates are computed for two independent cameras mounted on the same vehicle. These two independent trajectories are thereafter compared for consistency. Finally, we present qualitative experiments of an augmented reality (AR) system that depends on the aforementioned localization solution. Several screen shots of the AR system are shown confirming centimeter-level accuracy and subdegree angular precision.},

To solve the occlusion problem in congested traffic conditions, we have proposed an effective vehicle detection approach based on an and -or graph (AOG) in this paper. Our method includes three steps: constructing an AOG for representing vehicle objects in the congested traffic condition; training parameters in the AOG; and, finally, detecting vehicles using bottom-up inference. In AOG construction, sophisticated vehicle feature selection avoids using the easily occluded vehicle components but takes highly visible components into account. The vehicles are well represented by these selected vehicle features in the presence of a congested condition with serious vehicle occlusion. Furthermore, a hierarchical decomposition of the vehicle representation is proposed during AOG construction to further reduce the impact of vehicle occlusion. After AOG construction, all parameters in the AOG are manually learned from the training images or set and further applied to the bottom-up vehicle inference. There are two innovations of our method, i.e., the usage of the AOG in vehicle detection under congested traffic conditions and the special vehicle feature selection for vehicle representation. To fully test our method, we have done a quantitative experiment under a variety of traffic conditions, a contrast experiment, and several experiments on congested conditions. The experimental results illustrate that our method can effectively deal with various vehicle poses, vehicle shapes, and time-of-day and weather conditions. In particular, our approach performs well in congested traffic conditions with serious vehicle occlusion.},

Pedestrians, cars, motorcycles, and bicycles are classified based on their side views from a fixed camera. A moving object is segmented and tracked using background subtraction, silhouette projection, an area ratio, a Kalman filter, and appearance correlation operations. For the classification of a segmented object, a combination of static and spatiotemporal features based on the cooccurrence of its appearance and the movements of its local parts is proposed. To extract the static appearance features, adaptive block-based gradient intensities and histograms of oriented gradients are proposed. For the spatiotemporal features, the optical-flow-based entropy values of instantaneous and short-term movements are proposed. The former finds the spatial entropy values of the orientations and the amplitudes of optical flows in a block to extract the local movement information from two consecutive image frames. The latter finds the temporal entropy values of the tracked optical flows in different orientation bins to extract the short-term movement information from several consecutive frames. Linear support vector machines with batch incremental learning are proposed to classify the four classes of objects. Experimental results from 12 test video sequences and comparisons with several feature descriptors show the effect of the proposed classification system and the advantage of the proposed features in classification.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we describe a novel algorithm that counts and classifies highway vehicles based on regression analysis. This algorithm requires no explicit segmentation or tracking of individual vehicles, which is usually an important part of many existing algorithms. Therefore, this algorithm is particularly useful when there are severe occlusions or vehicle resolution is low, in which extracted features are highly unreliable. There are mainly two contributions in our proposed algorithm. First, a warping method is developed to detect the foreground segments that contain unclassified vehicles. The common used modeling and tracking (e.g., Kalman filtering) of individual vehicles are not required. In order to reduce vehicle distortion caused by the foreshortening effect, a nonuniform mesh grid and a projective transformation are estimated and applied during the warping process. Second, we extract a set of low-level features for each foreground segment and develop a cascaded regression approach to count and classify vehicles directly, which has not been used in the area of intelligent transportation systems. Three different regressors are designed and evaluated. Experiments show that our regression-based algorithm is accurate and robust for poor quality videos, from which many existing algorithms could fail to extract reliable features.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a nonintrusive video-based system for vehicle speed measurement in urban roadways. Our system uses an optimized motion detector and a novel text detector to efficiently locate vehicle license plates in image regions containing motion. Distinctive features are then selected on the license plate regions, tracked across multiple frames, and rectified for perspective distortion. Vehicle speed is measured by comparing the trajectories of the tracked features to known real-world measures. The proposed system was tested on a data set containing approximately 5 h of videos recorded in different weather conditions by a single low-cost camera, with associated ground truth speeds obtained by an inductive loop detector. Our data set is freely available for research purposes. The measured speeds have an average error of −0.5 km/h, staying inside the [−3, +2] km/h limit determined by regulatory authorities in several countries in over 96.0% of the cases. To the authors' knowledge, there are no other video-based systems able to achieve results comparable to those produced by an inductive loop detector. We also show that our license plate detector outperforms two other published state-of-the-art text detectors, as well as a well-known license plate detector, achieving a precision of 0.93 and a recall of 0.87.},

  abstract = {Driver-assistance systems that monitor driver intent, warn drivers of lane departures, or assist in vehicle guidance are all being actively considered. It is therefore important to take a critical look at key aspects of these systems, one of which is lane-position tracking. It is for these driver-assistance objectives that motivate the development of the novel "video-based lane estimation and tracking" (VioLET) system. The system is designed using steerable filters for robust and accurate lane-marking detection. Steerable filters provide an efficient method for detecting circular-reflector markings, solid-line markings, and segmented-line markings under varying lighting and road conditions. They help in providing robustness to complex shadowing, lighting changes from overpasses and tunnels, and road-surface variations. They are efficient for lane-marking extraction because by computing only three separable convolutions, we can extract a wide variety of lane markings. Curvature detection is made more robust by incorporating both visual cues (lane markings and lane texture) and vehicle-state information. The experiment design and evaluation of the VioLET system is shown using multiple quantitative metrics over a wide variety of test conditions on a large test path using a unique instrumented vehicle. A justification for the choice of metrics based on a previous study with human-factors applications as well as extensive ground-truth testing from different times of day, road conditions, weather, and driving scenarios is also presented. In order to design the VioLET system, an up-to-date and comprehensive analysis of the current state of the art in lane-detection research was first performed. In doing so, a comparison of a wide variety of methods, pointing out the similarities and differences between methods as well as when and where various methods are most useful, is presented},

This paper describes a low-level object tracking system that produces accurate vehicle motion trajectories that can be further analyzed to detect lane centers and classify lane types. Accompanying techniques for indexing and retrieval of anomalous trajectories are also derived. The predictive trajectory merge-and-split algorithm is used to detect partial or complete occlusions during object motion and incorporates a Kalman filter that is used to perform vehicle tracking. The resulting motion trajectories are modeled using variable low-degree polynomials. A K-means clustering technique on the coefficient space can be used to obtain approximate lane centers. Estimation bias due to vehicle lane changes can be removed using robust estimation techniques based on Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC). Through the use of nonmetric distance functions and a simple directional indicator, highway lanes can be classified into one of the following categories: entry, exit, primary, or secondary. Experimental results are presented to show the real-time application of this approach to multiple views obtained by an uncalibrated pan-tilt-zoom traffic camera monitoring the junction of two busy intersecting highways.},

In the proposed method, the features of vehicles are learned as a deformable object model through the combination of a latent support vector machine (LSVM) and histograms of oriented gradients (HOGs). The detection algorithm combines both global and local features of the vehicle as a deformable object model. Detected vehicles are tracked through a particle filter, which estimates the particles' likelihood by using a detection scores map and template compatibility for both root and parts of the vehicle while considering the deformation cost caused by the movement of vehicle parts. Tracking likelihoods are iteratively used as a priori probability to generate vehicle hypothesis regions and update the detection threshold to reduce false negatives of the algorithm presented before. Extensive experiments in urban scenarios showed that the proposed method can achieve an average vehicle detection rate of 97% and an average vehicle-tracking rate of 86% with a false positive rate of less than 0.26%.},

Information from a sequence of images, which were captured by a monocular camera attached to a survey vehicle at a maximum frequency of 3 frames/s, is fused with position and orientation estimates from the inertial system to correct for inherent error accumulation in such integral-based systems. The rotations and translations are estimated from point correspondences tracked through a sequence of images. To reduce unsuitable correspondences, we used constraints such as epipolar lines and correspondence flow directions. The vision algorithm automatically operates and involves the identification of point correspondences, the pruning of correspondences, and the estimation of motion parameters. To simply obtain the geodetic coordinates, i.e., latitude, longitude, and altitude, from the translation-direction estimates from the vision sensor, we expand the Kalman filter space to incorporate distance. Hence, it was possible to extract the translational vector from the available translational direction estimate of the vision system. Finally, a decentralized Kalman filter is used to integrate the position estimates based on the vision sensor with those of the inertial system. The fusion of the two sensors was carried out at the system level in the model. The comparison of integrated vision-inertial-measuring-unit (IMU) position estimates with those from inertial-GPS system output and actual survey demonstrates that vision sensing can be used to reduce errors in inertial measurements during potential GPS outages.},

However, illumination variation effect is still of its major technical problem in real urban driving environments. In this paper, we propose a novel vision-based traffic light detection method for driving vehicles, which is fast and robust under different illumination conditions. The proposed method contains two stages: the candidate extraction stage and the recognition stage. On the candidate extraction stage, we propose an adaptive background suppression algorithm to highlight the traffic light candidate regions while suppressing the undesired backgrounds. On the recognition stage, each candidate region is verified and is further classified into different traffic light semantic classes. We evaluate our method on video sequences (more than 5000 frames and labels) captured from urban streets and suburb roads in varying illumination and compared with other vision-based traffic detection approaches. The experiment shows that the proposed method can achieve a desired detection result with high quality and robustness; simultaneously, the whole detection system can meet the real-time processing requirement of about 15 fps on video sequences.},

Lane-level positioning methods must reliably work in real time in a wide range of environments, spanning rural to urban areas. Traditional positioning sensors such as the Global Navigation Satellite Systems may have poor performance in dense urban areas, where obstacles block satellite signals. This paper presents a sensor fusion technique that uses computer vision and differential pseudorange Global Positioning System (DGPS) measurements to aid an inertial navigation system (INS) in challenging environments where GPS signals are limited and/or unreliable. To supplement limited DGPS measurements, this method uses mapped landmarks that were measured through a priori observations (e.g., traffic light location data), taking advantage of existing infrastructure that is abundant within suburban/urban environments. For example, traffic lights are easily detected by color vision sensors in both day and night conditions. A tightly coupled estimation process is employed to use observables from satellite signals and known feature observables from a camera to correct an INS that is formulated as an extended Kalman filter. A traffic light detection method is also outlined, where the projected feature uncertainty ellipse is utilized to perform data association between a predicted feature and a set of detected features. Real-time experimental results from real-world settings are presented to validate the proposed localization method.},

By adopting heterogeneous sensors in a WSN, we can explore the potential of using complementary physical information to perform more complicated sensing computation. However, the collaboration among heterogeneous sensors, such as the collaborative sensing mechanism (CSM), is not well studied in current state-of-the-art research. In this paper, we design and implement EasiSee, a real-time vehicle classification and counting system based on WSNs. Our contributions are as follows. First, we propose a CSM, which coordinates the power-hungry camera sensor and the power-efficient magnetic sensors, reducing the overall system energy consumption and maximizing system lifetime. Second, we propose a robust vehicle image-processing algorithm, i.e., a low-cost image processing algorithm (LIPA). LIPA reduces environment noise and interference with low computation complexity. In the verification section, the vehicle detection accuracy turned out to be 95.31%, which pave the way for CSM. The time of image processing is around 200 ms, which indicates that our LIPA is computationally economical. With the overall energy consumption reduced, EasiSee achieves classification accuracy of 93%. Based on these experiments and analysis, we conclude that EasiSee is a practical and low-cost affordable solution for traffic-information acquisition.},

Extensive research has shown that pretty good performance can be obtained on public data sets by various state-of-the-art approaches, especially the deep learning methods. However, deep learning methods require extensive computing resources. In addition, these approaches mostly concentrate on single image detection and recognition task, which is not applicable in real-world applications. Different from previous research, we introduce a unified incremental computational framework for traffic sign detection, tracking, and recognition task using the mono-camera mounted on a moving vehicle under non-stationary environments. The main contributions of this paper are threefold: 1) to enhance detection performance by utilizing the contextual information, this paper innovatively utilizes the spatial distribution prior of the traffic signs; 2) to improve the tracking performance and localization accuracy under non-stationary environments, a new efficient incremental framework containing off-line detector, online detector, and motion model predictor together is designed for traffic sign detection and tracking simultaneously; and 3) to get a more stable classification output, a scale-based intra-frame fusion method is proposed. We evaluate our method on two public data sets and the performance has shown that the proposed system can obtain results comparable with the deep learning method with less computing resource in a near-real-time manner.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a more practical and accurate method for calibrating the roadside camera used in traffic surveillance systems. Considering the characteristics of the traffic scenes, we propose a minimum calibration condition that consists of two vanishing points and a vanishing line, which can be easily satisfied in most traffic scenes. Based on the minimum calibration condition, we provide a calibration method to estimate camera intrinsic parameters and rotation angles, which employs least squares optimization instead of closed-form computation. Compared with the existing calibration methods, our method is suitable for more traffic scenes and is able to accurately determine more camera parameters including the principal point. By making full use of video information, multiple observations of the vanishing points are available from different objects. For more accurate calibration, we present a dynamic calibration method using these observations to correct camera parameters. As for the estimation of the camera translation vector, known lengths in the road or known heights above the road are exploited. The experimental results on synthetic data and real traffic images demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and practicability of the proposed calibration method.},

  abstract = {Background modeling has played an important role in detecting the foreground for video analysis. In this paper, we presented a novel background modeling method for foreground segmentation. The innovations of the proposed method lie in the joint usage of the pixel-based adaptive segmentation method and the background updating strategy, which is performed in both pixel and object levels. Current pixel-based adaptive segmentation method only updates the background at the pixel level and does not take into account the physical changes of the object, which may result in a series of problems in foreground detection, e.g., a static or low-speed object is updated too fast or merely a partial foreground region is properly detected. To avoid these deficiencies, we used a counter to place the foreground pixels into two categories (illumination and object). The proposed method extracted a correct foreground object by controlling the updating time of the pixels belonging to an object or an illumination region respectively. Extensive experiments showed that our method is more competitive than the state-of-the-art foreground detection methods, particularly in the intermittent object motion scenario. Moreover, we also analyzed the efficiency of our method in different situations to show that the proposed method is available for real-time applications.},

In this context, it is often important to be able to analyze the video in real-time. The huge amount of data generated by the increasing number of cameras is an obstacle to reach this goal. A solution consists in selecting in the video only the regions of interest, essentially the vehicles on the road areas. In this paper, we propose to extract significant segments of the regions of interest and to analyze them temporally to count vehicles and to define their behaviors.

First, the foreground prediction blocks are extracted according to the motion vectors of the H.265/HEVC bitstreams. Next, these foreground prediction blocks are clustered into the region of interests (ROIs), which are the possible area position of moving objects in the current frame. Finally, the state of moving objects is identified by matching moving objects and these ROIs. In order to estimate the number of moving objects, which move toward a pre-defined direction, a tripwire is set to a detecting area. Any moving objects crossing the tripwire and satisfying the intrusion conditions are counted. With the proposed method, the number of moving objects can be directly estimated in the compressed domain video. This approach significantly increase the processing speed more than 400% at the cost of less than 0.02% accuracy degradation compared with the traditional pixel domain approach. The research results can be applied to traffic management, real-time analysis of surveillance application, and other related areas.},

Many solutions use a camera and state-of-the-art image processing technologies. As image processing is relative resource consuming, either very simple methods are used, or the processing is performed off-site, on a central computer. The approach presented in this paper employs a powerful embedded system to process the video images in real-time, so that the communication traffic is limited to the transmission of retrieved statistics. In order to fit into the limited resources and still allow vehicle size and speed measurements, special data representations and processing pipeline has to be used.

In order to improve the accuracy of vehicle counting, the cross-lane vehicles are detected and repeated counting for one vehicle is avoided. In order to reduce the classification errors, the space ratio of the blob and data fusion are used to reduce the classification errors caused by vehicle occlusions. This system was tested under four different weather conditions. The accuracy of vehicle counting was 97.4% and the error of vehicle classification was 8.3%.

Traditional detection and classification methods are computationally highly expensive and become unsuccessful in many cases such as occlusion among the vehicles and when differences between pixel intensities of vehicles and backgrounds are small. In this paper, a novel detection and classification method is proposed using multiple time-spatial images (TSIs), each obtained from a virtual detection line on the frames of a video. Such a use of multiple TSIs provides the opportunity to identify the latent occlusions among the vehicles and to reduce the dependencies of the pixel intensities between the still and moving objects to increase the accuracy of detection performance as well as to achieve an improved classification performance. In order to identify the class of a particular vehicle, a two-step k nearest neighborhood classification scheme is proposed by utilizing the shape-based, shape-invariant, and texture-based features of the segmented regions corresponding to the vehicle appeared in appropriate frames that are determined from the TSIs of the video. Extensive experimentations are carried out in vehicular traffics of varying environments to evaluate the detection and classification performance of the proposed method, as compared with the existing methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method provides a significant improvement in counting and classifying the vehicles in terms of accuracy and robustness alongside a substantial reduction of execution time, as compared with that of the other methods.},

  abstract      = {As current video based vehicle detection algorithms can not detect the traffic congestion accurately, this paper presents a new adaptive background updating algorithm based on Kalman filtering and inter-frame centroid distance. Firstly, a Gauss mixture background model is set up to extract the moving vehicles. Then, with Kalman filtering method, the moving vehicles are tracked to identify their motion states. This method predicts the centroid position of the next frame vehicles. The Euclidean distance of the centroids of the adjacent frames vehicles are counted and the appropriate threshold is set up to realize the identification and the mark of stationary vehicles in the video. This improved background updating algorithms can better judge the traffic congestion, and it lays a foundation for improving the accuracy rate of the detection of traffic flow. The proposed algorithm has been tested for multiple traffic videos. The results show that the algorithm is of good real-time ability, environmental adaptability and accuracy.},

  abstract      = {Real-time detection of vehicular volume, mean speed and vehicle type has important significance, but the existing video-based detection methods are not satisfactory at processing speed and accuracy. This paper proposes a high-efficient method to detect all the three parameters from two foreground temporal-spatial images (TSIs) directly, which are obtained from two virtual detection lines (VDLs) in video frames. Such usage of the TSIs provides a feasible approach to solve the problems of vehicle occlusion, mean-speed estimation, and vehicle classification without using original frame images. Firstly, for improving the accuracy of detection, during generation of the foreground TSIs, we set a small-wide region of interest for each VDL and propose a local background subtraction method and an improved moving shadows elimination method to eliminate unwanted interferences. Then, in order to reduce the calculation complexity, during extraction of the parameters, we analyze the feasibility of vehicle classification direct from the foreground TSIs, and propose a method to extract shape-feature vector from the TSIs directly. The dependence on original frame images is minimized, so the pressing speed is improved obviously. Experimental results prove the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method.},

The videos captured using the closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras placed in roadsides or driveways are used for the surveillance. The surveillance system includes detection of moving vehicles, counting the number of vehicles and the classification of the detected vehicles. The main challenge of the computer vision technique is the real time applicability of the algorithms used. In this work a vehicle detection and classification algorithm which works in real time is proposed. The detection is carried out by the method of background subtraction where the background is modeled using the mixture of Gaussians and the detected vehicles are classified using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with a new set of features, Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and geometric measures of the vehicles. Experimental results shows that the proposed method with the new combination of features as training parameters for ANN give better result as compared to other popular algorithms.},

A survey of the state-of-the-art video processing techniques in traffic flow monitoring is presented in this paper. Firstly, vehicle detection is the first step of video processing and detection methods are classified into background modeling based methods and non-background modeling based methods. In particular, nighttime detection is more challenging due to bad illumination and sensitivity to light. Then tracking techniques, including 3D model-based, region-based, active contour-based and feature-based tracking, are presented. A variety of algorithms including MeanShift algorithm, Kalman Filter and Particle Filter are applied in tracking process. In addition, shadow detection and vehicles occlusion bring much trouble into vehicle detection, tracking and so on. Based on the aforementioned video processing techniques, discussion on behavior understanding including traffic incident detection is carried out. Finally, key challenges in traffic flow monitoring are discussed.},

However, outdoor illuminations, the cast shadows and vehicle variations often create problems for video analysis and processing. Thus, the authors propose a real-time cost-effective traffic monitoring system that can reliably perform traffic flow estimation and vehicle classification at the same time. First, the foreground is extracted using a pixel-wise weighting list that models the dynamic background. Shadows are discriminated utilising colour and edge invariants. Second, the foreground on a specified check-line is then collected over time to form a spatial-temporal profile image. Third, the traffic flow is estimated by counting the number of connected components in the profile image. Finally, the vehicle type is classified according to the size of the foreground mask region. In addition, several traffic measures, including traffic velocity, flow, occupancy and density, are estimated based on the analysis of the segmentation. The availability and reliability of these traffic measures provides critical information for public transportation monitoring and intelligent traffic control. Since the proposed method only process a small area close to the check-line to collect the spatial-temporal profile for analysis, the complete system is much more efficient than existing visual traffic flow estimation methods.},

  abstract = {Supplying realistically textured 3D city models at ground level promises to be useful for pre-visualizing upcoming traffic situations in car navigation systems. Because this pre-visualization can be rendered from the expected future viewpoints of the driver, the required maneuver will be more easily understandable. 3D city models can be reconstructed from the imagery recorded by surveying vehicles. The vastness of image material gathered by these vehicles, however, puts extreme demands on vision algorithms to ensure their practical usability. Algorithms need to be as fast as possible and should result in compact, memory efficient 3D city models for future ease of distribution and visualization. For the considered application, these are not contradictory demands. Simplified geometry assumptions can speed up vision algorithms while automatically guaranteeing compact geometry models. In this paper, we present a novel city modeling framework which builds upon this philosophy to create 3D content at high speed.},
